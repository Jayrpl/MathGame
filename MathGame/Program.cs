// Project Requirements
// 1. Math Game must contain the 4 basic operations
// 2. The divisions should result on INTEGERS ONLY and dividends should go from 0 to 100. Example: Your app shouldn't present the division 7/2 to the user, since it doesn't result in an integer.
// 3. Users should be presented with a menu to choose an operation
// 4. record previous games in a List and there should be an option in the menu for the user to visualize a history of previous games.
